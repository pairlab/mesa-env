MESA is a framework for building, scaling, and evaluating language-conditioned tabletop manipulation policies.
The project includes:

- **MESA-Gen** for scalable task and demonstration generation.
- **MESA-Bench** for standardized evaluation across in-distribution, spatial, category, instance, and compositional generalization settings.

## Installation

MESA uses `uv` for environment and dependency management.

1. Install `uv` using the official guide: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
2. Clone the public repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pairlab/mesa-env.git mesa
   cd mesa
   ```
3. Sync dependencies from the repository root:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
4. Optional: install LeRobot export dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra lerobot
   ```
5. Run setup scripts (configures robosuite and downloads the simulation assets and the fixed evaluation initial states from Hugging Face):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, see `docs/getting_started/installation.md`.
